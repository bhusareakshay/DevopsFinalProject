# Running the code

We created a shell script which is responsible to do the following tasks:

Create Kubernetes cluster using terraform 	

Deploy backend application

Create a service for backend

Deploy frontend application

Create a service for frontend

Create a Prometheus dashboard

Create a Grafana dashboard

**Note:** This script runs only on Linux as it involves modifying the kube config file. To run the project on Windows/Mac, run each command from the script manually, making changes according to the OS file system.

### Steps to follow:
* Move to Infrastructure > Cluster
 	
* Run the deployApp.sh script
 	
* Copy the backend service url
 	
* Go to AWS Route53 and create a hosted zone with domain “csye6225-su19-bhusarea.me” 
 	
* Add a Record set with Type A and an Alias to the backend service url (the LoadBalancer url can be selected from the dropdown)
 	
* Save the changes
 	
* Access the frontend load balancer url to run the application
 	
* Prometheus can be accessed with its service url
 	
* Grafana can be accessed with it’s service url
